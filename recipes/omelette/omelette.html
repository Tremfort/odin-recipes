        <p>An omelette is a classical breakfast around the world, made mainly with eggs. Despite being called a "French omelet," 
        the truth is that the origin of this dish is unclear, as there are indications that suggest it dates back to prehistoric times.</p>
        <p> But today we're not here for a history lesson. So we're bringing you a simple omelet recipe that you can make for a 
        quick and easy breakfast.</p>
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Well, eggs... of course. Two eggs per person.</li>
                <li>A little bit of cheese.</li>
                <li>black pepper</li>
                <li>butter or oil</li>

            </ul>
          <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Break the eggs into a bowl and beat them vigorously. This quick beating incorporates air and makes for a fluffier omelet.</li>
                <li>Place a skillet over medium heat and melt a small amount of butter (or use oil if you prefer). Have everything ready before 
                pouring in the eggs to prevent them from overcooking.</li>
                <li> Add the mixture to the center of the pan. Allow the base to cook slightly while the surface remains moist; this is crucial 
                for adding the filling without breaking the omelet.</li>
                <li> When the top is still slightly runny, add the cheese, pepper or other ingredient of your choice to one side of the omelet.</li>
                <li> Using a spatula, quickly fold the empty side over the side with the filling. The heat will seal the edges and allow the
                 inside to finish cooking without losing its softness.</li>
                <li> Cook for a few more moments and flip the omelet so that the other side browns. Then carefully remove it and serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
